Next.js is a React framework that enables developers to build high-performance web applications with features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and automatic code splitting. It simplifies the development process by handling the necessary tooling and configuration for React, allowing developers to focus on building their application. citeturn0search0

**Key Features of Next.js:**

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Generates HTML on the server for each request, improving performance and SEO for dynamic content.

- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pre-renders pages at build time, creating static HTML files for better performance and caching.

- **Automatic Code Splitting:** Automatically splits code to ensure that each page only loads the necessary JavaScript, reducing load times.

- **File-Based Routing:** Uses the file system to define routes, simplifying the creation of dynamic and nested routes.

- **API Routes:** Allows the creation of API endpoints within the application, enabling backend communication without setting up a separate server.

**Sample Interview Questions and Answers:**

1. **What is Next.js, and how does it differ from traditional React applications?**

   *Answer:* Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, providing built-in features like automatic code splitting, file-based routing, and API routes. Unlike traditional React applications that render on the client side, Next.js can pre-render content on the server, enhancing performance and SEO. citeturn0search0

2. **Explain the difference between Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) in Next.js.**

   *Answer:* In Next.js, SSR generates HTML on the server for each incoming request, which is suitable for pages with dynamic content that changes frequently. SSG, on the other hand, pre-renders pages at build time, creating static HTML files that can be served quickly, making it ideal for pages with content that doesn't change often. citeturn0search1

3. **How does Next.js handle routing, and what is file-based routing?**

   *Answer:* Next.js uses a file-based routing system where the file structure within the `pages` directory determines the routes of the application. Each file corresponds to a route; for example, `pages/index.js` maps to the root route `/`, and `pages/about.js` maps to `/about`. Dynamic routes can be created using bracket notation, such as `pages/posts/[id].js` for `/posts/1`. citeturn0search0

4. **What are API routes in Next.js, and how do you create them?**

   *Answer:* API routes in Next.js allow developers to create backend API endpoints within the application. To create an API route, add a JavaScript file to the `pages/api` directory. For instance, `pages/api/hello.js` would correspond to the `/api/hello` endpoint. In this file, you can define server-side logic to handle requests and responses. citeturn0search0

5. **Can you explain the concept of Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) in Next.js?**

   *Answer:* Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) enables Next.js to update static content after the initial build. Developers can specify a revalidation interval, allowing the page to be regenerated in the background at that interval. This approach combines the performance benefits of static generation with the ability to serve updated content without requiring a full rebuild. citeturn0search0

6. **How does Next.js optimize images by default?**

   *Answer:* Next.js provides a built-in `Image` component that automatically optimizes images. It handles tasks like resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats such as WebP. This ensures that images are delivered efficiently based on the user's device and screen resolution, improving performance. citeturn0search0

7. **What is the purpose of the `getServerSideProps` function in Next.js?**

   *Answer:* The `getServerSideProps` function is used to fetch data on the server side for a page before rendering it. This function runs on each request and allows for server-side rendering of pages with dynamic data. The fetched data is then passed as props to the page component. citeturn0search0

8. **How can you implement dynamic routing in Next.js?**

   *Answer:* Dynamic routing in Next.js is achieved by creating files with bracket notation in the `pages` directory. For example, to create a dynamic route for blog posts, you can create a file named `pages/posts/[id].js`. This file will match routes like `/posts/1` or `/posts/hello-world`. Within the component, you can use the `useRouter` hook from `next/router` to access the dynamic parameters. citeturn0search0

9. **What are the benefits of using Next.js over Create React App (CRA)?**

   *Answer:* Next.js offers several advantages over Create React App, including built-in support for server-side rendering and static site generation, automatic code splitting, optimized performance, and a simplified file-based routing system. These features provide a more streamlined development experience and better performance out of the box. citeturn0search0

10. **How does Next.js handle CSS and styling?**

    *Answer:* Next.js supports various styling options, including global CSS files, CSS Modules for component-scoped styles, and popular CSS-in-JS libraries. Global CSS can be imported in the `pages/_app.js` file, while CSS Modules allow for modular and reusable styles by importing CSS files directly into components.
