1. **Building a small Angular app or feature**
   - Creating a simple component with bindings, events, and services.
   - Handling form inputs using **Reactive Forms** or **ngModel**.
   - Implementing a simple **API call using HttpClient**.

2. **RxJS Observables and Operators**
   - Writing a function that filters, maps, or combines streams.
   - Using **mergeMap, switchMap, concatMap**, or **debounceTime**.
   - Managing **subscriptions** correctly with **takeUntilDestroyed** (which you already use).

3. **TypeScript Fundamentals**
   - Writing interfaces, types, or generics.
   - Enforcing type safety and working with optional properties.
   - Using utility types like `Partial<T>`, `Readonly<T>`, or `Pick<T>`.

4. **CSS Challenges**
   - Implementing a responsive UI using Flexbox/Grid.
   - Handling dynamic class changes with `ngClass` and `ngStyle`.

5. **Debugging or Fixing a Bug**
   - They might provide broken code and ask you to debug it.

6. **Basic BPMN or Camunda-related Question**
   - Since they mention **BPMN**, they could ask you to explain how you would **model a workflow in BPMN or Camunda**.

---

Sure! Here are the answers to the **possible technical interview questions** related to **Angular, TypeScript, RxJS, performance optimization, and your experience**:

---

## **1. Angular Fundamentals**

### **Q: Explain the difference between services and components in Angular.**
- **Components** control the UI and handle user interactions. Each component has a template (HTML), styles (CSS), and logic (TypeScript).
- **Services** provide reusable business logic and state management, typically using dependency injection to share data across components.

üëâ **Example:** A `UserService` handles API calls for user data, while a `UserComponent` displays user information.

---

### **Q: What are directives in Angular? Can you name a few?**
Directives are instructions that modify the behavior of elements in the DOM. There are **three types**:
1. **Component Directives** ‚Äì A special directive with a template (e.g., `@Component`).
2. **Structural Directives** ‚Äì Modify the DOM structure (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`).
3. **Attribute Directives** ‚Äì Modify element behavior or appearance (e.g., `ngClass`, `ngStyle`, `customHighlightDirective`).

üëâ **Example:** 
```ts
@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {
    this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
  }
}
```

---

### **Q: How does Change Detection work in Angular?**
- Angular runs a **Change Detection Cycle** to check for UI updates.
- The default **ChangeDetectionStrategy** (`Default`) checks all components when an event occurs.
- Using **OnPush Change Detection** can optimize performance by only checking components when their `@Input()` changes.

üëâ **Example:**
```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>{{ data }}</p>`,
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() data!: string;
}
```

---

### **Q: What are Lifecycle Hooks, and which ones have you used?**
Lifecycle hooks allow you to tap into different stages of a component's lifecycle.

üîπ Common ones:
1. `ngOnInit()` ‚Äì Runs once after the component is initialized.
2. `ngOnChanges()` ‚Äì Runs when an `@Input()` value changes.
3. `ngAfterViewInit()` ‚Äì Runs after the view and child components load.
4. `ngOnDestroy()` ‚Äì Runs when a component is about to be destroyed (good for unsubscribing from Observables).

üëâ **Example:**
```ts
ngOnInit() {
  console.log('Component initialized');
}

ngOnDestroy() {
  console.log('Component destroyed');
}
```

---

## **2. RxJS and Observables**

### **Q: How do you handle an HTTP request that should be retried when it fails?**
Using **retry()** or **retryWhen()**:
```ts
this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .pipe(
    retry(3), // Retry up to 3 times before failing
    catchError(error => {
      console.error('Request failed:', error);
      return of([]); // Return an empty array as fallback
    })
  )
  .subscribe();
```

---

### **Q: What is the difference between BehaviorSubject, Subject, and ReplaySubject?**
| Type | Initial Value | Emits last value? | Stores values? |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Subject | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| BehaviorSubject | ‚úÖ Yes (default value) | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| ReplaySubject | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes (stores multiple values) |

üëâ **Example Usage:**
```ts
const subject = new Subject<number>();
const behaviorSubject = new BehaviorSubject<number>(0);
const replaySubject = new ReplaySubject<number>(2); // Stores last 2 values
```

---

### **Q: When should you use switchMap instead of mergeMap?**
- **`switchMap`** cancels the previous request if a new one comes in (great for autocomplete search).
- **`mergeMap`** runs multiple requests in parallel.

üëâ **Example using switchMap for live search:**
```ts
searchInput.pipe(
  debounceTime(300),
  switchMap(query => this.http.get(`/search?q=${query}`))
);
```

---

## **3. TypeScript Questions**

### **Q: Explain the difference between interface vs type alias.**
Both define object shapes, but:
- **Interfaces** can be extended (`extends`) and implemented (`implements`).
- **Type Aliases** can use unions (`|`).

üëâ **Example:**
```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

type Status = 'active' | 'inactive'; // Cannot be done with interfaces
```

---

### **Q: What are Type Guards, and when would you use them?**
Type Guards help determine an object‚Äôs type at runtime.

üëâ **Example:**
```ts
function isUser(obj: any): obj is User {
  return (obj as User).id !== undefined;
}
```

---

### **Q: What does `readonly` do in TypeScript?**
Marks properties as immutable.

üëâ **Example:**
```ts
interface User {
  readonly id: number;
  name: string;
}
```

---

## **4. Performance Optimization in Angular**

### **Q: How do you lazy-load modules in Angular?**
Use **loadChildren** in `app-routing.module.ts`.

üëâ **Example:**
```ts
{
  path: 'admin',
  loadChildren: () => import('./admin/admin.module').then(m => m.AdminModule)
}
```

---

### **Q: How do you use OnPush Change Detection to optimize performance?**
It reduces unnecessary re-renders by checking only when `@Input()` changes.

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
```

---

### **Q: What are trackBy functions, and when should you use them?**
They prevent unnecessary DOM updates in `*ngFor`.

üëâ **Example:**
```ts
<tr *ngFor="let item of items; trackBy: trackById">
```
```ts
trackById(index: number, item: Item) {
  return item.id;
}
```

---

## **5. Experience-Based Questions**

### **Q: Can you describe a challenging Angular project you worked on?**
Talk about:
- A performance issue you optimized.
- A complex UI feature you implemented.
- A debugging challenge you solved.

---

### **Q: How do you handle state management in Angular?**
- **Services with BehaviorSubject** (Simple apps)
- **NgRx or Akita** (Complex apps)

---

### **Q: Have you worked with REST APIs or GraphQL?**
Yes, Angular's **HttpClient** is used for REST API calls.

üëâ **Example:**
```ts
this.http.get<User[]>('/api/users')
  .subscribe(users => console.log(users));
```

---

## **6. BPMN and Process Modeling**

### **Q: Have you worked with BPMN or Camunda?**
If **yes**, talk about modeling workflows.
If **no**, say you're familiar with **BPMN concepts** like tasks, events, and gateways.

---

## **Final Thoughts**
- Expect **RxJS-heavy** questions.
- Be ready to **write small Angular snippets**.
- **Know Change Detection**, **Lazy Loading**, and **Performance optimizations**.
